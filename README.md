# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

## Green

Vulnerability #1: XXS Time 

Description: Stored XXS is possible due to a sanitation oversight regarding feedback emails on green site. To execute, send an email with any name and any address with the XSS script as the message. The XXS used for this attack is straight from the provided example, ```<script>alert('Cole found the XSS!');</script>``` (replaced Mallory with Cole).

Vulnerability #2: User Enumeration Nation 

Description: User enumeration is evident on green site, due to a small mistake with the class names that handle failed login attempts. When using an invalid username, the error message is displayed in normal text. When using a valid username (such as the one provided, "jmonroe99"), the text is bold. An attacker could assume that valid usernames therefore will show up in bold. 

Greensite error class name ("failed") when the username is invalid:

Greensite error class name ("failure") when the username is valid:

Blue and redsite error class whether username is valid or not:

The reason that no other sites have this issues is because greensite has two classes dedicated to handling failed login attempts. This mislable causes the error message to visibly change to the user.
